It is an independent city-state located within Rome, Italy, and is home to the Pope and the central government of the Catholic Church.\n\nVatican City is so small that it's actually the smallest internationally recognized sovereign state in the world, with a population of just over 800 people. Despite its tiny size, it has its own government, currency, postal system, and even its own branch of the military, known as the Pontifical Swiss Guard.\n\nInterestingly, Vatican City is also home to numerous famous landmarks, including St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums, which attract millions of visitors each year.",
