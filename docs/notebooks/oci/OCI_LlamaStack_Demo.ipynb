    "   pip install llama-stack-client oci\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure OCI credentials:**\n",
    "   - Set up `~/.oci/config` with your OCI credentials\n",
    "   - Set the `OCI_COMPARTMENT_OCID` environment variable\n",
    "   - Set the `OCI_REGION` environment variable\n",
    "\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on a global network of Oracle-managed data centers. It provides a complete range of highly automated, high-performance, and cost-effective services, including compute, storage, networking, databases, analytics, machine learning, IoT, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, OCI is Oracle's public cloud offering, designed to compete with industry giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of what OCI is and what makes it stand out:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Cloud Computing Model:**\n",
      "    *   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides fundamental computing resources (virtual machines, bare metal servers, storage, networking) over the internet. Users manage operating systems, applications, and data.\n",
      "    *   **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform for customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. This includes services like Oracle Autonomous Database, Kubernetes Engine, and Functions.\n",
      "    *   **Software as a Service (SaaS):** While OCI is primarily IaaS/PaaS, Oracle also offers many SaaS applications (like Fusion ERP, HCM, CRM) that run *on* OCI.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **\"Generation 2 Cloud\" Architecture:**\n",
      "    OCI often refers to itself as a \"Generation 2 Cloud.\" This implies a fundamental architectural difference from some older cloud platforms, focusing on:\n",
      "    *   **Performance:** Designed with non-oversubscribed resources (especially for bare metal compute), faster networking, and a focus on enterprise-grade workloads.\n",
      "    *   **Security-First:** A highly isolated network virtualization and a \"zero-trust\" security model from the ground up, aiming to prevent hypervisor attacks and provide strong isolation between customer workloads.\n",
      "    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Often boasts competitive pricing, especially for predictable, high-performance workloads, and strong support for \"bring your own license\" (BYOL) for Oracle software.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Key Services Offered:**\n",
      "    *   **Compute:** Virtual Machines (VMs), Bare Metal Servers (physical servers dedicated to a single customer), Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), Functions (serverless computing).\n",
      "    *   **Storage:** Block Storage, Object Storage (standard, infrequent access, archive tiers), File Storage, Database Storage.\n",
      "    *   **Networking:** Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs), Load Balancers, VPN Connect, FastConnect (dedicated network connectivity).\n",
      "    *   **Databases:**\n",
      "        *   **Autonomous Database:** A flagship service that automates patching, tuning, security, and backups for data warehousing (ADW) and transaction processing (ATP).\n",
      "        *   Exadata Cloud Service, MySQL HeatWave, NoSQL Database, PostgreSQL.\n",
      "    *   **Analytics & AI/ML:** Data Lake, Data Catalog, AI Services, Machine Learning Platform.\n",
      "    *   **Application Development:** API Gateway, DevOps, Container Registry.\n",
      "    *   **Security:** Identity and Access Management (IAM), Cloud Guard, Web Application Firewall (WAF), Security Zones.\n",
      "    *   **Management & Governance:** Monitoring, Logging, Cost Management, Resource Manager (Terraform integration).\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Key Differentiators & Advantages:**\n",
      "    *   **Superior for Oracle Workloads:** Unmatched performance and features for running Oracle databases (especially Exadata and Autonomous Database) and Oracle applications (EBS, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft, Siebel).\n",
      "    *   **Enterprise Focus:** Built from the ground up for mission-critical, high-performance enterprise workloads.\n",
      "    *   **Performance & Price-Performance:** Often cited for better performance on certain benchmarks due to its architecture, leading to a strong price-performance ratio.\n",
      "    *   **Security:** Emphasizes strong isolation and a security-first design.\n",
      "    *   **Hybrid Cloud:** Offers solutions like Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer for organizations that need cloud benefits within their own data centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Target Audience:**\n",
      "    *   Existing Oracle customers looking to migrate their on-premises databases and applications to the cloud.\n",
      "    *   Enterprises with demanding, performance-sensitive, or mission-critical workloads.\n",
      "    *   Organizations seeking strong database capabilities and automation.\n",
      "    *   Companies looking for competitive pricing and a robust security posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, OCI is Oracle's modern, high-performance, and secure public cloud platform, designed to cater to enterprise needs, with a particular strength in running Oracle's own software and databases.\n",

      "Here are 3 key benefits of using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for AI workloads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **High-Performance Compute with Leading GPUs:** OCI offers powerful NVIDIA GPUs (such as A100s and H100s) on bare metal and high-core count virtual machines. This provides the raw, uncompromised compute power essential for rapidly training complex deep learning models, running large-scale simulations, and performing high-throughput inference, significantly reducing model development and deployment times.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Cost-Effectiveness and Flexible Pricing:** OCI is often recognized for its competitive pricing compared to other major cloud providers, especially for high-performance resources like GPUs. It also typically features lower data egress fees, which can lead to substantial cost savings for data-intensive AI workloads that frequently move large datasets in and out of the cloud. Flexible consumption models further help optimize spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Integrated AI/ML Services and MLOps Platform:** OCI provides a growing suite of managed AI services (e.g., OCI Data Science, OCI AI Vision, OCI AI Language, OCI AI Speech, OCI AI Anomaly Detection) that simplify the entire machine learning lifecycle. These services offer pre-trained models, easy-to-use APIs, and a robust MLOps platform for managing data, developing, deploying, and monitoring models, accelerating time-to-value for AI initiatives.\n",
