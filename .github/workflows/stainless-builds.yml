run-name: Build Stainless SDK from OpenAPI spec changes

# This workflow uses pull_request_target, which allows it to run on pull requests
# from forks with access to secrets. This is safe because the workflow definition
# comes from the base branch (trusted), and the action only reads OpenAPI spec
# files without executing any code from the PR.
