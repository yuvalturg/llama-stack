    "# Migrating from Agent objects to Responses in Llama Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama Stack had a set of server APIs for creating and managing the components of an agent including endpoints for grouping tools, making an agent that uses those groups of tools, making a session for that agent, and making a turn for that session.  However, these server APIs are deprecated in Llama Stack 0.3.0.  The functionality in those server APIs continue to exist the client APIs, but they are relatively limited and are not expected to undergo substantial improvement so they are not recommended for new development.  Instead, the recommended replacement for those APIs is the OpenAI-compatible Responses API which provides an all-in-one API for doing agentic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about the Responses API and why you might want to use it see [Your agent, your rules: A deep dive into the Responses API with Llama Stack](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/08/20/your-agent-your-rules-deep-dive-responses-api-llama-stack) from Red Hat and/or [Why we built the Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/blog/responses-api/).  This notebook is more specifically focused on the following topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *What do I do if I have an existing system implemented using the old Llama Stack agent APIs and I want to use the Llama Stack Responses API instead?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we present the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Getting Started*: Instructions for setting up, configuring, creating a client, and testing it out.\n",
    "- *Legacy Agent API Example*: Code that creates and runs an agent using the Llama Stack client Agent APIs.\n",
    "- *Equivalent Responses API Example*: Code that does the same thing by calling the Responses API to show how you would rewrite the first example to use Responses API.  That is probably the best approach for most users who are using the old APIs and want to move to the new one.  That code is significantly simpler and more elegant than the equivalent code using the old APIs.\n",
    "- *Emulating the Legacy Agent API*: Code that provides a wrapper around the Responses API that emulates the old agent APIs along with code that mirrors the original example using that emulation.  Note that the emulation is a partial/incomplete emulation of the old APIs that is just powerful enough to implement the simple example.  It is meant to be a starting point for you to emulate those parts of the old agent APIs that are essential for your application.\n",
    "- *Adopting a simpler agent class*: A simpler wrapper that is less consistent with the old APIs but might be an easier starting point if complete compatibility with the old APIs are less essential.\n",
    "- *Human-in-the-loop tool approval*: Example of how to have an agent that checks with the user for approval before invoking a tool.\n",
    "- *Model safety*: Example of how safety models are used with both the old agent APIs and the new Responses API.\n",
    "- *ReAct agents*: Example of using the ReAct agent construct in the Llama Stack Python client library and how to accomplish something similar using the Responses API.\n",
    "- *Authored multi-step agentic flows*: Example of how to break a challenging agentic reasoning task into multiple steps to improve accuracy on the task.\n",
    "- *Multi-process architectures*: Thoughts on how to migrate applications that run different aspects of the old APIs in different processes (e.g., one process to make agents and another to consume them).\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, follow the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First install Llama Stack and all of the other dependencies for this notebook.\n",
    "One way to do that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First install Python 3.12 or later (do not try this with older versions of Python: it will not work).\n",
    "- Then make a Python virtual environment and start using it.\n",
    "- Then install Llama Stack.  For example, to install the latest from the main branch run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/llamastack/llama-stack.git\n",
    "pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/llamastack/llama-stack-client.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once everything is installed, run the Llama Stack server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "llama stack run starter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can also use `uv` for all of these commands, which is a very popular tool for managing Python configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also run the National Parks Service Model Context Protocol (MCP) server as described in [README_NPS.md](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/llama-stack-examples/blob/main/notebooks/01-responses/README_NPS.md).  Download it from that location and then run it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python nps_mcp_server.py --transport sse --port 3005\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use this notebook with some other MCP server, but then you will need to change the example query and the server details to match "

    "For most use cases, the approach above is probably the best way to migrate from the Agent API to the Responses API.  However, if you have a large amount of code that uses the old API, you might want to have some objects that emulate the old Agent API instead (the approach in the commented out example at the top of the previous session).  Here is a very simple example of how to do that.\n",

    "The simple example only covers the functionality needed in the original simple example above.  We'll get into some advanced functionality in later sections, but there are also many parameters in the legacy API that we do not provide sample code for.  We don't recommend trying to build a complete implementation of every parameter value in the entire API.  Instead, you can use this example as a starting point and then fill in those parameters and/or values that are important to your application."

Another disadvantage of course is that you no longer have access to the fine-grained control that you get from being able to make separate Moderations calls before and/or after Responses, inspect all the structured output and use it in your application.  For example, some chat UI applications might want to use different icons or colors for input moderation violations, output moderation violations, violations of different types, etc.  However, if you don't mind dealing with the data structures and you don't need all that fine-grained control, then the `extra_body` approach might be the ideal fit.

    "## ReAct Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The Llama Stack Python Client has a client-side [ReAct Agent](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack-client-python/blob/main/src/llama_stack_client/lib/agents/react/agent.py) construct.  This construct still works.  It operates by listing the tools and formulating a text prompt that combines the user request, system instructions, and tool list into one big text prompt.  Those system instructions direct the model to take in observations and output thoughts before selecting an action, which can improve accuracy because it forces the model to split up the challenging process of identifying the right tool and parameter values into multiple simpler steps.  The accuracy benefits come at a cost of longer latency and higher token generation charges since outputting thoughts takes time and tokens.  For some challenging, high-value tasks the improved accuracy is worth the added time and cost.  For more details about ReAct see [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct was a revolutionary technique in 2022 when the paper was first published, but it is less relevant today because the lessons from ReAct have been expanded upon and incorporated into other parts of the technology stack.  In particular, some key elements and where they have wound up are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Listing tools with formal input schemas*: In 2022, this needed to be done inside a single block of text because generative AI models were trained to take in a single block of text and output a single block of text.  However, modern \"chat completion\" models are generally trained to take a formal structure in which there are pre-defined separators and schemas for session history, tools, etc.  Of course, it is still *possible* to just lump all that info into a plain text blob like people did in 2022, but since the models are tuned to use the formal structure, it seems likely that you will get better results more often using that structure.  The way to use that structure is just to use the appropriate parameters in the Responses or Chat Completions APIs.  For example, if you list your tools in the `tools` parameter of Responses, a well-trained chat completion model is more likely to select the right tool more often than if you just describe them in plain text in the user message.\n",
    "- *Outputting thoughts before deciding how to ReAct*: Recent \"reasoning\" models are trained specifically to do this using a formal structure.  For example, gpt-oss uses a format called [Harmony](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/openai-harmony) in which the models output their reasoning before selecting tools and/or providing response text to end users for exactly this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are working with a modern \"reasoning\" model and an API that has formal structures for listing tools and outputting thoughts, then you would normally expect that your model and infrastructure are already providing the core benefits of ReAct.  On the other hand, if you are just using a \"chat completion\" model that is trained for tool selection but isn't explicitly trained to output thoughts before selecting a tool, then some sort of hybrid where you use a ReAct style prompt to encourage outputting thoughts before selecting a tool might be effective.

    "The offer of a reward is not part of the original ReAct paper, but it became popular around the same time because there were some anecdotes about it being effective.  Late 2022 through early 2023 were an extraordinarily peculiar time in the history of AI.  It seems not inconceivable it could be effective if the training data it is exposed to includes many examples of people offering a reward for answering a question followed by extraordinarily thoughtful, high quality answers.  In that case, the model pre-training could have learned this statistical trend and thus be more likely to produce extraordinarily thoughtful, high quality answers following such a prompt.  On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be substantial evidence that this actually works and it does add to the length of the input, driving up compute costs and latency.  So it is not included in the prompt for the \"ReAct-inspired agentic reasoning for chat completions models using the Responses API\" section later in this notebook, but feel free to try adding it and see for yourself if it helps."

    "On this simple example query, it seems to get comparable results to the results you get from calling Responses directly (see the earlier \"Equivalent Responses API Example\" section for more details).  The ReAct agent is instructing the model to output thoughts before acting which potentially makes it more effective.  On the other hand, pushing tool descriptions into the text of the prompt (instead of using the tool-list structure that the model is trained to process) potentially makes it less effective.  So either might be more effective for your use cases.  The Responses API is a core element of the Llama Stack strategy which focuses mainly on compatibility with the de facto industry \"standard\" of the OpenAI APIs.  In contrast, the ReAct agent is left over from an older strategy for Llama Stack and thus seems unlikely to undergo substantial improvement in the future.\n",

Conversely, if you are using a model that is only pre-trained and instruction-tuned but without a formal chat completion template, then you probably want to use something like the original ReAct capability described above.  However, many models fall in between these extremes: they are trained to recognize specific structures for a chat-completions API including both session history and tool calling, but they are not explicitly trained to output reasoning traces.  For models of this sort, you want to use those API structures for chaining messages together and telling the model what tools are available.

There isn't really a *general* solution for having models with limited effectiveness (and all models are limited -- some more than others).

For example, imagine you are building this national parks assistant and your user research suggests that many users want to find upcoming events for parks, so you really want to do this very well even when the questions are not worded very precisely.

    "As you can see this multi-step flow is able to get to the correct response because it was coded to follow the correct steps.  In practice, it is often necessary to do this sort of thing when trying to make an agentic system reliable enough to deploy into a production environment.\n",

    "- You could wrap the entire flow into a single object and call it \"EventSearchOptimizedAgent\" or something like that.\n",

    "## Multi-process architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples in all of the previous sections of this notebook assume that the agent creation, session creation, and turn creation are all taking place in the same process.  However, some users of the legacy Agents API might be having one process that creates agents (e.g., an agent management console) and another process that uses the agents (e.g., a chatbot app that invokes that process).  Assuming these processes have different life cycles and run on different kinds of machines, here are some examples of ideas for how to handle these cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the agent creation logic is simple and static, then you can just move that agent creation logic into the application that uses the agent as in the examples above.  One downside of doing that is that you need to release a new version of the application that uses the agent every time the definition of the agent changes.  If that's not feasible for you, consider one of the other options.\n",
    "- You can have some sort of key-value storage mechanism contain a description of the agent (i.e., the instructions, list of tools).  The process that creates agents can write that configuration to the storage and the process that invokes the agent can read from it.\n",
    "- You can have the process that creates the agent deploy a container with that agent into a cluster and the process that invokes the agent call that container (which would then call Llama Stack via the Responses API).  This is a much heavier and more disruptive change than just putting agent configuration into a key-value store, but potentially much more powerful too since you can build complex agents with multiple phases that use different models under different circumstances, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other possible architectures to explore too."
